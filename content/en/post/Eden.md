## 🎮 Introduction to Yuzu

**Eden** is an open-source Nintendo Switch emulator developed by the Citra team. Known for its high performance and growing compatibility, Eden is one of the most popular Switch emulators in the world.

> ⚠️ **Legal Note**: This emulator is intended only for playing games you legally own. Emulation for backup and research purposes is legal, but piracy is not.

## Game configuration in the emulator

### Adding the games folder

In the emulator menu, **double-click** then select the folder containing all your games.

### Recommended folder structure

For optimal organization of your library, here is the recommended structure:

````
Switch Games/
├── Mario Kart 8 Deluxe/
│   ├── BASE/                # 🎮 Main game (main file)
│   ├── UPDATE/              # 🔄 Game update (recommended)
│   └── DLC/                 # 📦 Downloadable content (optional)
├── New Super Mario Bros U Deluxe/
│   ├── BASE/                # 🎮 Main game
│   ├── UPDATE/              # 🔄 Game update
│   └── DLC/                 # 📦 Additional DLC
├── The Legend of Zelda BOTW/
│   ├── BASE/
│   ├── UPDATE/
│   └── DLC/
└── Super Mario Odyssey/
    ├── BASE/
    └── UPDATE/              # (No DLC for this game)
````

### Content types

{{< admonition tip "Understanding the folders" >}}
- **BASE** 📁: The main game you download
- **UPDATE** 📁: Updates and patches (recommended)
- **DLC** 📁: Additional paid content (optional but recommended)
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition success "Advantages of this organization" >}}
✅ **Automatic detection**: Games are automatically added to the emulator  
✅ **Simplified management**: No need to manually select each ROM  
✅ **Clear organization**: Easy to see what content you have for each game  
✅ **Easy maintenance**: Adding/removing content is simple
{{< /admonition >}}

> **📝 Important note**: If a game has no update or DLC, there is no need to create the corresponding folders. Only create folders for the content you own.

### Result

Once this structure is in place, your emulator will automatically detect all games in the "Switch Games" folder and neatly organize them in your library! 🎯

### Installing updates
```bash
# In Yuzu
File → Install Files to NAND
→ Select the .nsp update file
```

### Installing DLC
```bash
# In Yuzu
File → Install Files to NAND
→ Select the .nsp DLC file
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common problems and solutions

#### Game does not launch
```bash
Solutions in order of priority:
1. Check firmware installation
2. Check keys (prod.keys/title.keys)
3. Test with default settings
4. Reinstall Visual C++ Redistributables
5. Update Eden to the latest version
```

#### Low performance
```bash
Immediate optimizations:
1. Reduce Resolution Scaler to 1x
2. Enable Multicore CPU Emulation
3. Use Vulkan instead of OpenGL
4. Close background applications
5. Check CPU/GPU temperatures

Final note: Installing a mod to increase FPS will NOT increase your FPS. If a game is designed to run at 30fps, but on your PC it runs at 15-20fps (hello Pokémon Scarlet), adding a mod will do NOTHING. Get a better PC, and for those who say I'm lying, I laugh in advance at their ability to talk nonsense.
```

#### Frequent crashes
```bash
Diagnostics:
1. Check game integrity (SHA256)
2. Test without mods
3. Lower the accuracy level
4. Disable overclocking
5. Test with an older version of Yuzu
```

#### Desynchronized audio
```bash
Solutions:
1. Change Output Engine (auto → WASAPI)
2. Adjust the audio buffer
3. Check audio drivers
4. Disable Windows audio effects
```

#### Corrupted graphics
```bash
Fixes:
1. Delete the shader cache
2. Change graphics API (Vulkan ↔ OpenGL)
3. Update GPU drivers
4. Lower Accuracy Level
5. Temporarily disable ASTC decoding
```
