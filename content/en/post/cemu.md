## 🎮 Introduction to Cemu

**Cemu** is the most performant and accomplished Nintendo Wii U emulator available. Developed since 2015, it allows you to play Wii U exclusives on PC with spectacular graphical improvements, mods and excellent compatibility.

## 🔧 Step 1: Downloading Cemu

### Recommended option: Official version
```bash
# Official website
https://github.com/cemu-project/Cemu/releases
```

1. **Click** on your OS
2. **Download** `cemu_X.X.X.zip` (latest version)
3. **Extract** to a dedicated folder (e.g.: `Emulators\Cemu` or at the root of a secondary drive)

## 📦 Downloading your games

### Step 1: Access the game library

Go to **[🎮 Axekin Games - Nintendo Wii U](https://www.axekin.com/search?platform=wiiu)** to access the Nintendo Wii U game collection.

### Step 2: Download the game

1. **Search** for the desired game in the list
2. **Click** on the download button
3. **Wait** for the download to complete

### Step 3: Extract the file

Once the download is complete, **extract** the archive with one of these software:

| Software | Download Link | Compatibility |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **7-Zip** | [Download 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) | Windows/Linux |
