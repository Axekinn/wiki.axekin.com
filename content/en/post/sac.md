## 🎮 Introduction to SteamAutoCrack

**SteamAutoCrack** is an automated tool that simplifies the Steam game patching process. It streamlines the entire procedure by automatically applying the necessary modifications to make games work without Steam authentication.

## 🔧 Step 1: Obtaining Required Files

### Game Downloads
```bash
# You need to create an account to download content
https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewforum.php?f=22
```

### Downloading SteamAutoCrack
```bash
# You need to create an account to download content
https://github.com/SteamAutoCracks/Steam-auto-crack/releases
```

## 📁 Step 2: File Preparation

### Game Extraction
Most downloaded games come with password protection:

```bash
# Default password (Base64 encoded)
Password: cs.rin.ru
```

### Folder Structure
After extraction, your game should look like:
```
YourGame/
├── steamapps/
│   └── common/
│       └── GameName/          # Main game directory
│           ├── GameName.exe   # Game executable
│           └── steam_api.dll  # Steam API library
└── other files...
```

## ⚙️ Step 3: Generating Steam API Key

### Get Your Steam API Key
```bash
# Steam Web API Key Registration
https://steamcommunity.com/dev/apikey
```

1. **Visit** the Steam Web API page
2. **Log in** with your Steam account
3. **Register** for a new API key
4. **Domain Name**: Enter any domain (e.g., `localhost`)
5. **Copy** the generated API key

### API Key Example
