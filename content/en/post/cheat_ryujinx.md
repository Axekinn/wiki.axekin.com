> **⚠️ Important**: Always backup your save files before installing cheats or mods. Some modifications can affect game stability.

## Introduction

**Ryujinx** supports both **cheat codes** and **game modifications (mods)** to enhance your Nintendo Switch gaming experience. Whether you want infinite health, unlock all items, or completely transform a game's graphics, this guide will show you exactly how to install them.

### What's the difference?

**Cheats vs Mods:**
- **Cheats**: Small code modifications (infinite money, max stats, etc.)
- **Mods**: Complete game content modifications (new textures, characters, levels, etc.)

Both use different installation methods and folder structures in Ryujinx.

## Installing Cheats on Ryujinx

### Step 1: Access the Mod Directory

#### Open Ryujinx and locate your game

1. **Launch** the Ryujinx emulator
2. **Right-click** on the game you want to add cheats to
3. Select **"Open Mods Directory"** from the context menu

### Step 2: Understanding the folder structure

#### Directory structure

When you open the mods directory, you'll see a path like this:
```
Ryujinx\mods\contents\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\
```

Where `XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX` is the **unique game ID** (Title ID) of your selected game.

**Examples of game IDs:**
- The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild: `01007EF00011E000`
- Super Mario Odyssey: `0100000000010000`
- Pokémon Sword: `0100ABF008968000`

### Step 3: Install cheat files

#### Extract and place cheat files

1. **Download** your cheat files (usually in .zip format)
2. **Extract** the archive contents
3. **Create the appropriate folder structure:**

```
Ryujinx\mods\contents\XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX\
└── Cheat_Name\
    └── cheats\
        ├── cheat1.txt
        ├── cheat2.txt
        └── other_cheats.txt
```

#### Detailed installation steps

4. **Navigate** to your game's mod directory
5. **Create a new folder** with the cheat name (ex: "Infinite_Money")
6. **Inside this folder**, create a subfolder called **"cheats"**
7. **Place all .txt cheat files** in the "cheats" folder

### Step 4: Enable cheats

#### Enable cheats in-game

1. **Launch your game** in Ryujinx
2. **Right-click** on the game title again
3. Select **"Manage Cheats"** or access via the menu
4. **Check the boxes** next to the cheats you want to enable
5. **Apply** the changes and restart the game if necessary

## Installing Mods on Ryujinx

### Step 1: Access the Mods Directory

#### Same initial process as for cheats

1. **Open Ryujinx**
2. **Right-click** on your target game
3. Click on **"Open Mods Directory"**

This opens: `AppData\Roaming\Ryujinx\mods\contents\<Game ID>\`

### Step 2: Create mod folder structure

#### Organize your mods correctly

1. **Create a new subfolder** under the game ID directory
2. **Name it descriptively** (ex: "Infinite_Lives", "HD_Textures", "Custom_Music")
3. This helps you **manage multiple mods** easily

**Example structure:**
```
Ryujinx\mods\contents\01007EF00011E000\
├── HD_Graphics_Mod\
│   └── romfs\
├── Infinite_Lives\
│   └── exefs\
└── Custom_Soundtrack\
    └── romfs\
```

### Step 3: Install mod files

#### Copy mod content

1. **Extract your downloaded mod files**
2. **Locate the romfs or exefs folder** from the mod
3. **Copy these folders** into your newly created mod directory

**Types of mod folders:**
- **romfs**: Game content modifications (textures, models, audio)
- **exefs**: Executable modifications (code patches, gameplay changes)

#### Complete installation

4. **Navigate** to your mod's extraction folder
5. **Copy the entire romfs or exefs folder**
6. **Paste** into your created mod directory

### Step 4: Enable mods

#### Enable installed mods

1. **Launch Ryujinx**
2. **Right-click** on your game
3. Select **"Manage Mods"**
4. **Enable/disable** mods according to your preferences
5. **Start the game** to see the changes

└── Gameplay_Overhaul\
    ├── romfs\
    │   └── GameData\
    └── exefs\
        └── main.npdm
```

#### Mod compatibility

**Compatibility testing:**
1. **Install one mod at a time**
2. **Test game stability**
3. **Check for conflicts** before adding others
4. **Take notes** on working combinations

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Cheats not working

#### Common problems and solutions

**🚫 Cheat files not detected:**
- Check folder structure: `Game_ID\Cheat_Name\cheats\*.txt`
- Check file extensions (.txt, not .txt.txt)
- Ensure no extra spaces in folder names

**⚠️ Cheats causing crashes:**
- Disable all cheats and test them one by one
- Check cheat compatibility with game version
- Use cheats from reliable sources
- MAKE SURE THE CHEAT VERSION MATCHES THE GAME VERSION

### Mods not loading

#### Debugging mod issues

**📁 Incorrect folder structure:**
```
❌ Incorrect:
Ryujinx\mods\contents\GAME_ID\romfs\...

✅ Correct:
Ryujinx\mods\contents\GAME_ID\Mod_Name\romfs\...
```

**🎮 Game-specific issues:**
- Check mod compatibility with your game version
- Check if the mod requires a specific firmware version
- Test with the mod disabled to confirm it's the cause
