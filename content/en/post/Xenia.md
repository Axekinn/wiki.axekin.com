## 🎮 Introduction to Xenia

**Xenia** is the most advanced open-source Xbox 360 emulator available. Developed since 2013, it emulates the PowerPC Xenon architecture of the Xbox 360 and offers growing compatibility with many iconic games from Microsoft's console.

> 💡 **Important note**: Xenia requires a powerful CPU with good single-thread performance. Recent GPUs with Vulkan support give the best results.

> 💡 **Xenia Manager**: For better understanding and usage of Xenia, we'll use Xenia Manager. This isn't something official from the Xenia devs, but there's nothing better for beginners on this emulator.

## 🔧 Step 1: Download Xenia Manager

### Master Version (Stable)
```bash
# Official site
https://github.com/xenia-manager/xenia-manager/releases
```

1. **Click** on "xenia_manager.zip"
2. **Download** `xenia_master.zip`
3. **Extract** to a dedicated folder (e.g., `Documents\Xenia` or at the root of another drive, not C)

## Game Download

### Step 1: Access the game library

Go to **[🎮 Axekin Games - Xbox 360](https://www.axekin.com/search?platform=xbox360)** to access the Xbox 360 game collection.

### Step 2: Download the game

1. **Search** for the desired game in the list
2. **Click** on the download button
3. **Wait** for the download to complete

### Step 3: File extraction

Once the download is finished, **extract** the archive with one of these software:

| Software | Download Link | Compatibility |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **7-Zip** | [Download 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) | Windows/Linux |
| **WinRAR** | [Download WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) | Windows |

> **💡 Tip**: 7-Zip is free and open-source, while WinRAR requires a license after the trial period.

**Result**: You'll get game files ready to be used with Xenia! 🎯

## 📁 Step 2: Folder Structure

Organize your games with this structure:

```
Xbox 360 Games/
├── Forza Horizon/
│   ├── BASE/                # 🎮 Base game (main file)
│   ├── UPDATE/              # 🔄 Game update (recommended)
│   └── DLC/                 # 📦 Downloadable content (optional)
├── Skate 3/
