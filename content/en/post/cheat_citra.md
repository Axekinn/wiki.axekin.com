> **⚠️ Important Warning**: Using cheats can sometimes corrupt your save files or make certain games unstable. Use them at your own risk!

## Introduction

Using cheats on the **Citra** emulator can sometimes be confusing for new users. This comprehensive guide will explain **step by step** how to configure and effectively use cheat codes on your emulated Nintendo 3DS games.

### General Process

1. **Launch Citra** → Load your game
2. **Emulation Menu** → Cheats
3. **Add Cheat** → Enter the code
4. **Enable the cheat** → Test in-game
5. **Check** version/region if there's a problem

## Prerequisites

Before starting, make sure you have:

- ✅ **Citra** installed and functional (recommended version: latest stable)
- ✅ A **3DS game** loaded and functional
- ✅ **Cheat codes** compatible with your game version
- ✅ A **backup** of your progress (strongly recommended)

## Step 1: Access the cheats menu

### Initial launch

1. **Start Citra** and wait for the emulator to list your games
2. Once your game is displayed, **Right-click** then **Properties** then go to the last tab **Cheats**

### Cheats interface

A new window opens with:
- **List of available cheats** (empty at first)
- **"Add Cheat" button** to add new cheats
- **Checkboxes** to enable/disable cheats
- **Edit and delete buttons**

## Step 2: Add a new cheat

### Creating a cheat

1. Click on **"Add Cheat"** in the cheats window
2. A dialog box appears with three fields:
   - **Name**: Descriptive name of the cheat
   - **Notes**: Optional description
   - **Code**: The cheat code itself

### Naming options

**Recommended descriptive names:**
- `Infinite Money`
- `Unlimited Lives`
- `All Items`

**Useful notes to add:**
- Compatible game version
- Region (EU/US/JP)
- Code effects

**Citra code format:**
```
[Cheat Name]
ADDRESS VALUE
```

## Step 3: Code format and syntax

### Code structure

Citra codes follow this specific format:

```cheat
[Gold 999999 (Code Offset 1)]
0808E0E4 000F423F

[Gold 999999 (Code Offset 2)]
080900A4 000F423F

[Gold 999999 (Code Offset 3)]
08092064 000F423F

[Max SP (Code Offset 1)]
08ED0CF8 00000003

[Max SP (Code Offset 2)]
08ED2CB8 00000003

[Max SP (Code Offset 3)]
08ED4C78 00000003
```

**General structure:**
```
[Descriptive cheat name]
MEMORY_ADDRESS HEXADECIMAL_VALUE

[Another cheat]
MEMORY_ADDRESS HEXADECIMAL_VALUE
```

> **💡 Tip**: These example codes come from *Bravely Default* and are fully functional, but serve here only as demonstration.

## Step 4: Activation and testing

### Activation procedure

1. **Enter the code** in the appropriate field
2. **Give an explicit name** to the cheat
3. Click **"OK"** to save
4. **Check the box** next to the cheat to activate it
5. **Return to the game** to test

### Effect verification

Once the cheat is activated, you should observe:

**Immediate modifications:**
- Change in money values
- Statistics modification
- Items added to inventory

**Effects after restart:**
- Some cheats require a restart
- Save before restarting
- Check effect persistence

## Troubleshooting - Problem resolution

### 🚫 The cheat doesn't work

**Possible causes:**
- Incompatible game version
- Different region (US vs EU vs JP)
- Poorly formatted code
- Incorrect memory address

**Solutions:**
1. Check version/region correspondence
2. Test with other codes from the same game
3. Consult specialized forums
4. Try with a different ROM

### 💥 The game crashes or becomes unstable

**Immediate actions:**
1. **Immediately disable** all cheats
2. **Restart** the emulator
3. **Restore** an earlier save
4. **Test cheats one by one** to identify the problem

**Prevention:**
- Save before using new cheats
- Don't activate too many cheats simultaneously
- Use codes from reliable sources

### ⚠️ Partially functional codes

**Symptoms:**
- Some effects work, others don't
- Incorrect values applied
- Temporary effects only

**Solutions:**
- Check if the code requires multiple offsets
- Try applying all code offsets
- Consult the source code documentation
