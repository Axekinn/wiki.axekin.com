# Complete Guide: Installing Texture Packs on Azahar Emulator

## Introduction

The **Azahar** emulator, based on Citra, allows you to significantly improve the visual experience of Nintendo 3DS games through texture packs. These packs replace original textures with high-definition versions, offering noticeably enhanced graphics.

### 2.2 Compatibility Verification
Make sure the texture pack matches:
- Your ROM region (EUR, USA, JPN)

## Step 3: Texture Pack Installation

### 3.1 Accessing the Game's Texture Folder

1. **Download** the texture pack (usually a .zip or .7z file)
2. **Extract** the contents directly into the opened folder
3. **Verify** that the texture files (.png) are properly placed in this folder

### 3.3 Final Folder Structure

```

    ├── tex1_0x87654321_14.png

```
