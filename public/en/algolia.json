    "title": "Lossless Scaling Configuration for Emulators","content": "\r🚀 Introduction to Lossless Scaling\rLossless Scaling is a powerful tool for frame generation and upscaling that can significantly improve both performance and visual quality in games and emulators. Unlike GPU-integrated solutions (DLSS, FSR), Lossless Scaling works at the system level and is compatible with all GPUs.\nMain Advantages\r✨ Why use Lossless Scaling?\nFPS Boost: Generates intermediate frames to double/triple your framerate Visual Enhancement: High-quality upscaling for higher resolutions Universal Compatibility: Works with NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel Emulator Optimization: Especially effective for Switch, PS2, PS3 Low Latency: Technology optimized to minimize input lag Ideal Use Cases\rWhere Lossless Scaling excels:\nEmulated games running at native 30 FPS (Pokémon, Zelda, etc.) Resource-intensive emulators (RPCS3, Yuzu) Modest PCs needing a performance boost Upscaling 1080p → 1440p/4K Overall smoother gameplay Downloading Lossless Scaling\rWhere to buy\r🛒 Lossless Scaling on Steam\nPlease consider buying the tool—it\u0026rsquo;s very affordable for what it offers. If you can\u0026rsquo;t, you can download it from here.\nFirst Launch \u0026amp; Initial Setup\rMain Interface\rOn first launch, Lossless Scaling displays a minimalist interface with several sections:\nInterface sections:\nScaling Mode: Upscaling mode Scaling Type: Upscaling algorithm Frame Generation: Frame generation settings Capture Method: Screen capture method Hotkeys: Keyboard shortcuts ⚙️ Detailed Configuration for Emulators\r⚙️ Optimized Lossless Scaling Settings (2025)\rRecommended Profiles by Priority\rHere are the configurations to prioritize based on your goal (quality or performance), based on the latest visual tests and comparisons:\n1. Maximum Quality (Image: BEST / Perf: SLOW)\rType: LSG 3.1\rFlow scale: 90\rMultiplier: 4\rPerformance: OFF Use this profile if you want the best possible image quality and your GPU can handle it.\n2. Balanced Quality/Performance (Image: BALANCED)\rType: LSG 3.1\rFlow scale: 65\rMultiplier: 4\rPerformance: OFF This profile offers an excellent compromise between smoothness and sharpness, recommended for most users.\n3. Maximum Performance (Image: QUACK / Perf: FASTEST)\rType: LSG 3.1\rFlow scale: 65\rMultiplier: 4\rPerformance: ON Prioritize this if you want to maximize FPS, especially on modest setups or for very demanding games.\nTip: Older versions (LSG 1.0) are now obsolete and should be avoided.\nIntegration Tips\rAdjust the profile according to your hardware and priorities (quality or performance). For most users, the \u0026ldquo;Balanced\u0026rdquo; profile is recommended. Don\u0026rsquo;t hesitate to test different settings to find the best compromise for your setup. Avoid using both the emulator\u0026rsquo;s internal scaling and Lossless Scaling at the same time to prevent double upscaling. 🔧 Troubleshooting\rCommon Issues \u0026amp; Solutions\rExcessive Latency (Input Lag)\rSymptom: Noticeable delay between your actions and on-screen response.\nSolutions in order:\n1. Lower the frame generation multiplier\rx4 → x3 → x2 → OFF\r2. Switch frame generation mode\rLS1 → LSFG\r3. Disable VSync in the emulator\r4. Lower the scaling factor\r2x → 1.5x → 1.2x\r5. Change capture method\rAuto → DXGI Desktop Duplication → Windows Graphics Capture\r6. Increase process priority\rNormal → High → Realtime (test only) \u0026ldquo;Low Latency\u0026rdquo; Configuration:\nScaling Type: AMD FSR Scaling Factor: 1.2x Frame Generation: LSFG x2 ONLY Capture Method: DXGI Desktop Duplication Priority: High Emulator VSync: OFF Visual Artifacts \u0026amp; Ghosting\rSymptom: Trails, ghost images, smeared textures.\nSolutions:\nFor ghosting (trails):\n1. Lower frame generation multiplier\r2. Switch from LS1 to LSFG\r3. Increase sharpness (0.8 → 1.0)\r4. Ensure the game runs at stable native FPS\r5. Disable motion blur in the emulator For graphical artifacts:\n1. Change scaling type (FSR → NIS or vice versa)\r2. Lower sharpness (0.9 → 0.6)\r3. Change capture method\r4. Update GPU drivers\r5. Disable overlays (Discord, Steam, etc.) \u0026ldquo;Quality First\u0026rdquo; Configuration:\nScaling Type: NIS Scaling Factor: max 1.5x Frame Generation: LSFG x2 Sharpness: 0.7 Capture Method: DXGI Desktop Duplication ❓ FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions\rGeneral Questions\rQ: Does Lossless Scaling work with all emulators?\nA: Yes, Lossless Scaling works at the system level and is compatible with all Windows emulators. Results may vary depending on the emulator and game.\nQ: Is it legal to use Lossless Scaling?\nA: Absolutely, it\u0026rsquo;s an official software sold on Steam that enhances the display of any Windows application.\nQ: Can I use it alongside native DLSS/FSR in the emulator?\nA: Yes, but it\u0026rsquo;s generally not recommended (double upscaling). Choose one or the other for best results.\nTechnical Questions\rQ: What\u0026rsquo;s the difference between LSFG and LS1?\nA: LSFG (Lossless Scaling Frame Generation) is the latest technology, more efficient and with lower latency. LS1 is the older generation, to be used if LSFG is unstable.\nQ: Can my AMD/Intel GPU use Lossless Scaling?\nA: Yes! Unlike DLSS (NVIDIA only), Lossless Scaling works on all GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel).\nQ: How much VRAM is needed?\nA: Generally 4GB minimum, 6-8GB recommended. Upscaling and frame generation use extra VRAM.\nQ: Is latency really noticeable?\nA: With LSFG x2, added latency is minimal (5-10ms). For competitive games, it\u0026rsquo;s noticeable, but for solo/emulation, it\u0026rsquo;s negligible.\nQ: Can I use Lossless Scaling with native PC games?\nA: Yes, Lossless Scaling works with any Windows game or application.\n🎯 Conclusion\rLossless Scaling is a powerful tool that can transform your emulation experience, especially on demanding emulators like Yuzu, RPCS3, or PCSX2. With proper configuration, you can:\nMain Benefits\r✅ Advantages of Lossless Scaling:\nDouble your FPS on native 30fps games Improve visual quality with smart upscaling Minimal latency with LSFG technology Compatible with all GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel) Easy to use once properly configured Support: For any questions or issues, check out the Lossless Scaling Discord or specialized emulation forums.\n","date": "2025-10-07 00:00:00",

Older versions of Windows should follow a similar process.\nInstalling NPCAP\rDue to licensing issues, XLink Kai ships with WinPCAP which unfortunately is not compatible with loopback adapters. To solve this problem, you will need to install NPCAP. Version 1.31 is known to be stable.\nDownload NPCAP from the official website Install NPCAP with the default options (simply click \u0026ldquo;Next\u0026rdquo; until the end) Running kaiLoopbackBridge\rOpen Windows Explorer and navigate to C:\\Program Files (x86)\\XLink Kai\\ Find kaiLoopbackBridge64.exe, right-click, Run as Administrator Read the warning, press any key to continue Select Nintendo Switch as the emulator type The loopback adapter will now be automatically configured Close kaiLoopbackBridge. We will use it again later. ⚙️ Installing and Configuring Ryujinx\rRyujinx setup is quite simple, check the Ryujinx Guide for basic installation.\nNetwork settings\rFor LAN Games\rOnce Ryujinx is running, access the configuration by clicking Options then Settings Click the System tab Check the Enable VSync box Check the Enable Guest Internet Access box Click the Multiplayer tab Under the LAN heading, set Network Interface to XLink Kai Loopback Switch XXXX Save the configuration and exit Ryujinx For Local Wireless Games\rOnce Ryujinx is running, access the configuration by clicking Options then Settings Click the System tab Check the Enable VSync box Click the Network tab Uncheck the Enable Guest Internet Access box Under the Multiplayer heading, set Mode to ldn_mitm Under the LAN heading, set Network Interface to XLink Kai Loopback Switch XXXX Save the configuration and exit Ryujinx 🎮 Playing a game on XLink Kai\rSince Ryujinx and XLink Kai cannot communicate directly with each other (yet), kaiLoopbackBridge is used as a \u0026ldquo;bridge\u0026rdquo; between them.\nStart XLink Kai and log in Start kaiLoopbackBridge, navigate through the prompts and keep it open for the entire duration of your gaming session. After a few seconds, XLink Kai will see a Nintendo Switch under the Metrics tab. Start Ryujinx and launch your game. Ryujinx must not be running before you launch kaiLoopbackBridge. Navigate to a game arena and play! Important advice\rMake sure to always launch the applications in this order:\nXLink Kai kaiLoopbackBridge Ryujinx Troubleshooting\rIf you encounter connection problems:\nCheck that all firewalls allow XLink Kai and Ryujinx Make sure the loopback adapter is properly configured Restart all applications in the correct order Reminder: Emulation is legal if you legally own the games you emulate.
