## 🚀 Introduction to Lossless Scaling

**Lossless Scaling** is a powerful tool for **frame generation** and **upscaling** that can significantly improve both performance and visual quality in games and emulators. Unlike GPU-integrated solutions (DLSS, FSR), Lossless Scaling works at the system level and is compatible with **all GPUs**.

### Main Advantages

> **✨ Why use Lossless Scaling?**
> 
> - **FPS Boost:** Generates intermediate frames to double/triple your framerate
> - **Visual Enhancement:** High-quality upscaling for higher resolutions
> - **Universal Compatibility:** Works with NVIDIA, AMD, and Intel
> - **Emulator Optimization:** Especially effective for Switch, PS2, PS3
> - **Low Latency:** Technology optimized to minimize input lag

### Ideal Use Cases

**Where Lossless Scaling excels:**
- Emulated games running at native 30 FPS (Pokémon, Zelda, etc.)
- Resource-intensive emulators (RPCS3, Yuzu)
- Modest PCs needing a performance boost
- Upscaling 1080p → 1440p/4K
- Overall smoother gameplay

### Downloading Lossless Scaling

#### Where to buy

**🛒 [Lossless Scaling on Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/)**

Please consider buying the tool—it's very affordable for what it offers. If you can't, you can download it from [here](https://cs.rin.ru/forum/viewtopic.php?f=41&t=94507).

### First Launch & Initial Setup

#### Main Interface

On first launch, Lossless Scaling displays a minimalist interface with several sections:

**Interface sections:**
- **Scaling Mode:** Upscaling mode
- **Scaling Type:** Upscaling algorithm
- **Frame Generation:** Frame generation settings
- **Capture Method:** Screen capture method
- **Hotkeys:** Keyboard shortcuts

### Recommended Profiles by Priority

Here are the configurations to prioritize based on your goal (quality or performance), based on the latest visual tests and comparisons:

#### 1. Maximum Quality (Image: BEST / Perf: SLOW)

```
Type: LSG 3.1
Flow scale: 90
Multiplier: 4
Performance: OFF
```
Use this profile if you want the best possible image quality and your GPU can handle it.

#### 2. Balanced Quality/Performance (Image: BALANCED)

```
Type: LSG 3.1
Flow scale: 65
Multiplier: 4
Performance: OFF
```
This profile offers an excellent compromise between smoothness and sharpness, recommended for most users.

#### 3. Maximum Performance (Image: QUACK / Perf: FASTEST)

```
Type: LSG 3.1
Flow scale: 65
Multiplier: 4
Performance: ON
```
Prioritize this if you want to maximize FPS, especially on modest setups or for very demanding games.

> **Tip:** Older versions (LSG 1.0) are now obsolete and should be avoided.

### Integration Tips

- Adjust the profile according to your hardware and priorities (quality or performance).
- For most users, the "Balanced" profile is recommended.
- Don't hesitate to test different settings to find the best compromise for your setup.
- Avoid using both the emulator's internal scaling and Lossless Scaling at the same time to prevent double upscaling.

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### Excessive Latency (Input Lag)

**Symptom:** Noticeable delay between your actions and on-screen response.

**Solutions in order:**

```
1. Lower the frame generation multiplier
   x4 → x3 → x2 → OFF
   
2. Switch frame generation mode
   LS1 → LSFG
   
3. Disable VSync in the emulator
   
4. Lower the scaling factor
   2x → 1.5x → 1.2x
   
5. Change capture method
   Auto → DXGI Desktop Duplication → Windows Graphics Capture
   
6. Increase process priority
   Normal → High → Realtime (test only)
```

**"Low Latency" Configuration:**
```yaml
Scaling Type: AMD FSR
Scaling Factor: 1.2x
Frame Generation: LSFG x2 ONLY
Capture Method: DXGI Desktop Duplication
Priority: High
Emulator VSync: OFF
```

#### Visual Artifacts & Ghosting

**Symptom:** Trails, ghost images, smeared textures.

**Solutions:**

**For ghosting (trails):**
```
1. Lower frame generation multiplier
2. Switch from LS1 to LSFG
3. Increase sharpness (0.8 → 1.0)
4. Ensure the game runs at stable native FPS
5. Disable motion blur in the emulator
```

**For graphical artifacts:**
```
1. Change scaling type (FSR → NIS or vice versa)
2. Lower sharpness (0.9 → 0.6)
3. Change capture method
4. Update GPU drivers
5. Disable overlays (Discord, Steam, etc.)
```

**"Quality First" Configuration:**
```yaml
Scaling Type: NIS
Scaling Factor: max 1.5x
Frame Generation: LSFG x2
Sharpness: 0.7
Capture Method: DXGI Desktop Duplication
```

## ❓ FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: Does Lossless Scaling work with all emulators?**  
A: Yes, Lossless Scaling works at the system level and is compatible with all Windows emulators. Results may vary depending on the emulator and game.

**Q: Is it legal to use Lossless Scaling?**  
A: Absolutely, it's an official software sold on Steam that enhances the display of any Windows application.

**Q: Can I use it alongside native DLSS/FSR in the emulator?**  
A: Yes, but it's generally not recommended (double upscaling). Choose one or the other for best results.

### Technical Questions

**Q: What's the difference between LSFG and LS1?**  
A: LSFG (Lossless Scaling Frame Generation) is the latest technology, more efficient and with lower latency. LS1 is the older generation, to be used if LSFG is unstable.

**Q: Can my AMD/Intel GPU use Lossless Scaling?**  
A: Yes! Unlike DLSS (NVIDIA only), Lossless Scaling works on all GPUs (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel).

**Q: How much VRAM is needed?**  
A: Generally 4GB minimum, 6-8GB recommended. Upscaling and frame generation use extra VRAM.

**Q: Is latency really noticeable?**  
A: With LSFG x2, added latency is minimal (5-10ms). For competitive games, it's noticeable, but for solo/emulation, it's negligible.

**Q: Can I use Lossless Scaling with native PC games?**  
A: Yes, Lossless Scaling works with any Windows game or application.

## 🎯 Conclusion

**Lossless Scaling** is a powerful tool that can transform your emulation experience, especially on demanding emulators like **Yuzu**, **RPCS3**, or **PCSX2**. With proper configuration, you can:
