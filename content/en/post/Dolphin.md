## 🎮 Introduction to Dolphin

**Dolphin** is the world's most advanced Nintendo GameCube and Wii emulator. Developed since 2003, it offers near-perfect compatibility, spectacular graphics enhancements, and unique features like online gaming and virtual reality.

## 🔧 Step 1: Downloading Dolphin

### Option 1: Stable Version (Recommended)
```bash
# Official site
https://dolphin-emu.org/download/
```

1. **Click** on "Download Dolphin 5.0"
2. **Download** `dolphin-x64-X.0.zip`
3. **Extract** to a dedicated folder (e.g., `Documents\Dolphin` or at the root of another drive, not C)

### Option 2: Dolphin Android
```bash
# Optimized mobile version
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.dolphinemu.dolphinemu
```

## Game Download

### Step 1: Access the game library

Go to **[🎮 Axekin Games - Nintendo Wii](https://www.axekin.com/games?platform=wii)** to access the Nintendo Wii game collection.

### Step 2: Download the game

1. **Search** for the desired game in the list
2. **Click** on the download button
3. **Wait** for the download to complete

### Step 3: File extraction

Once the download is finished, **extract** the archive with one of these software:

| Software | Download Link | Compatibility |
|----------|---------------|---------------|
| **7-Zip** | [Download 7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) | Windows/Linux |
| **WinRAR** | [Download WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/) | Windows |

> **💡 Tip**: 7-Zip is free and open-source, while WinRAR requires a license after the trial period.

**Result**: You'll get game files ready to be used with Dolphin! 🎯

## 📁 Step 2: Folder Structure

Create this folder structure to organize your files:

For optimal organization of your library, here's the recommended tree structure:

````
Wii Games/
├── Alice in Wonderland/
│   ├── BASE/                # 🎮 Base game (main file)
│   ├── UPDATE/              # 🔄 Game update (recommended)
│   └── DLC/                 # 📦 Downloadable content (optional)
├── Alvin and the Chipmunks: Chipwrecked/
│   ├── BASE/                # 🎮 Base game
│   ├── UPDATE/              # 🔄 Game update
│   └── DLC/                 # 📦 Additional DLC
├── Animal Crossing: City Folk/
│   ├── BASE/
│   ├── UPDATE/
│   └── DLC/
````

### Content types

{{< admonition tip "Understanding folders" >}}
- **BASE** 📁: The main game you download
- **UPDATE** 📁: Updates and patches (recommended)
- **DLC** 📁: Additional paid content (optional but recommended)
{{< /admonition >}}

{{< admonition success "Advantages of this organization" >}}
✅ **Automatic detection**: Games are automatically added to the emulator  
✅ **Simplified management**: No need to manually select each ROM  
✅ **Clear organization**: Easy to see what content you have for each game  
✅ **Easy maintenance**: Simplified content addition/removal
{{< /admonition >}}

> **📝 Important note**: If a game doesn't have updates or DLC, there's no need to create the corresponding folders. Only create folders for content you actually have.

### Result

Once this structure is in place, your emulator will automatically detect all games present in the "Wii Games" folder and organize them properly in your library! 🎯

## 💡 Portable Configuration (Recommended)

{{< admonition tip "Portable installation" >}}
**Before the first launch**, create a file named `portable.txt` at the root of the Dolphin directory. This operation will make the installation entirely portable.
{{< /admonition >}}

### Advantages of portable mode

| Aspect | Normal mode | Portable mode |
|--------|-------------|---------------|
| **Configurations** | Stored in system | Stored in folder |
| **Saves** | Scattered on computer | Centralized in folder |
| **Portability** | ❌ Tied to system | ✅ Easily movable |
| **Backup** | Hard to locate | Simple to backup |

### Structure after creating portable file

```
📁 Dolphin/
├── 🎮 Dolphin.exe
├── 📄 portable.txt          # ← Create this file!
│   ├── 📁 bis/
│   ├── 📁 games/
│   ├── 📁 profiles/
│   └── 📁 system/
└── 📄 Other files...
```

{{< admonition success "Result" >}}
**All your data** (configurations, saves, profiles) will be stored in the `portable.txt` file, greatly facilitating management and backups!
{{< /admonition >}}

### Creation instructions

1. **Navigate** to the Dolphin installation folder
2. **Create** a new file named exactly `portable.txt`
3. **Launch** Dolphin - it will automatically detect portable mode

> **📝 Note**: This operation must be performed **before** the first launch to be taken into account!

## ⚙️ Step 3: Installation and first launch

### First launch
1. **Execute** `Dolphin.exe`
2. **Accept (or not)** data sending
3. **Configure** the games folder: `Options → Configuration → Paths`
4. **Add** your ROM folder seen previously

## 🎯 Step 4: Basic system configuration

### General settings
```
Config → General
```

#### General tab
- **Enable Dual Core**: ✅ Enabled (greatly improves performance)
- **Enable Cheats**: ✅ Enabled (if you want to use codes)

#### Interface tab
- **Language**: Choose desired language
- **Theme**: Choose desired theme
- **Style**: Choose desired style
- **Download game covers etc.**: ✅ Enabled (for icons)

Leave the rest as default.

### Controller configuration

> For this, there are several configurations that will work better in certain games that have gyro, I'll leave that to YouTubers, they usually leave the config file in YouTube bio. I put Mario Galaxy, but you can put your game and you'll get the right configuration for your game (if it exists): [Tutorial for your controller](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=gyro+controller+configuration+dolphin+mario+galaxy)

## ⚙️ Step 5: Optimal graphics configuration

### Basic graphics settings
```
Graphics → General
```

#### Graphics Backend
- **Backend**: Vulkan (recommended) or Direct3D 11/12
- **Device**: Your main GPU
- **Aspect Ratio**: Auto or Force 16:9
- **V-Sync**: Enabled, same for fullscreen

#### Visual enhancements

**Essential enhancements:**
- **Internal Resolution**: What you want, higher value = more performance consumption
- **Anti-Aliasing**: Same as above
- **Anisotropic Filtering**: Same as above

Everything else, leave default settings

### Advanced settings
```
Graphics → Advanced
```

**Optimal configuration:**
- **Show FPS**: ✅ Enabled (performance monitoring)
- **Enable Progressive Scan**: ✅ Enabled
- **Backend Multithreading**: ✅ Enabled
- **Prefer Exclusive Fullscreen**: ✅ Enabled (reduces latency)

## 🌐 Advanced features

### Netplay (Online gaming)

#### Netplay configuration
```bash
# Host a session
